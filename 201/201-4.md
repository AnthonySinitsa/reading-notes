# html links, js functions, and intro to css layout

1. To create a basic link in HTML, we wrap text or other content inside the anchor (a) element
2. The href attribute in HTML stands for "hypertext reference" and specifies the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page or resource that the link is pointing to.
3. Make sure that the text inside the link is descriptive and clearly indicates the purpose of the link.

## css layout

1. elements on a webpage lay out in normal flow if you haven't applied any CSS to change the way they behave.
2. Nesting: Block-level elements can contain other block-level and inline elements. Inline elements, on the other hand, can only contain other inline elements, and cannot contain block-level elements.
3. static positioning is the default for every html element.
4. precise positioning, layering, flexible layout, animations. are few advanteages to using absolute positioning on element.
5. The key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning is how they are positioned relative to the viewport.

## learn js

1. A function declaration is a way to define a function in JavaScript. It consists of the keyword function, followed by the function name, an optional list of parameters enclosed in parentheses, and the function body enclosed in curly braces. A function invocation, on the other hand, is a way to call or execute a function that has already been defined. It consists of the function name followed by a pair of parentheses that may contain any arguments that the function expects.
2. When a function is defined with parameters, the parameters act as placeholders for values that will be passed to the function when it is called. When a function is called with arguments, the arguments are substituted for the corresponding parameters in the function definition.
