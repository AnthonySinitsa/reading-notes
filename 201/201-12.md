# chart.js, canvas

## javascript canvas

1. The canvas API provides methods to draw various shapes like rectangles, circles, lines, arcs, and curves. Developers can use the canvas element to create animations by updating the canvas at regular intervals using JavaScript. Developers can use the canvas element to manipulate and transform images in real-time. The canvas element is often used to create 2D games that run in the browser.
2. It tells the browser that there are no more elements within the canvas element that need to be processed.
3. The getContext() method takes a single argument, which specifies the type of context to be returned. For example, if you pass "2d" as an argument to getContext(), it returns a 2D rendering context object that provides methods for drawing and manipulating 2D graphics on the canvas.

## chart.js

1. Chart.js is a popular open-source JavaScript library that allows developers to create beautiful and interactive charts and graphs on a web page using HTML5 canvas. It provides an easy-to-use and flexible API for creating different types of charts such as line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and more.
2. A line chart is a common chart type used to display trends over time. It is useful for visualizing data that changes continuously over time, such as stock prices or weather data. A bar chart is a common chart type used to compare values across different categories. It is useful for visualizing data that is discrete or categorical, such as survey results or product sales. A pie chart is a common chart type used to display proportions of a whole. It is useful for visualizing data where each category represents a percentage of the whole, such as market share or budget allocation.

## create animated charts with chart.js

1. Charts are generally more visually appealing than tables, as they can use colors, labels, and other design elements to make the data more engaging and easier to understand. Charts can summarize large amounts of data in a compact and visually intuitive way. This can be particularly useful when dealing with complex data sets or large amounts of data that would be difficult to display in a table. Charts make it easy to compare data across different categories or time periods. This is particularly useful for identifying trends or patterns in the data.
