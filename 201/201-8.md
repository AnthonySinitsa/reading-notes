# css layout

## flexbox

1. Flexbox is a layout mode in CSS that is specifically designed for laying out content in one dimension - either as a row or a column. This means that the flexbox layout can handle content that needs to be laid out along a single axis, either horizontally or vertically.
2. he main axis is the primary axis along which the flex items are arranged, either horizontally (in a row) or vertically (in a column), and it's defined by the flex-direction property. The cross axis is the axis perpendicular to the main axis, and it's defined by the opposite direction of the main axis. So if the main axis is horizontal (row), then the cross axis is vertical (column), and vice versa.

1. Flexbox is designed to be flexible and responsive, allowing you to create layouts that can adapt to different screen sizes and devices. You can easily center items both horizontally and vertically, which can be a challenge with float-based layouts. Flexbox offers more precise control over alignment, allowing you to align items within a container in a variety of ways, including distributing them evenly, aligning them to the left, right, or center, or aligning them to the top, middle, or bottom.
