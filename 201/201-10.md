# debugging

1. Detection: Syntax errors are detected by the compiler or interpreter before the program is executed, while logic errors are only detected at runtime when the program is actually running. Cause: Syntax errors are caused by violating the syntax rules of the programming language, while logic errors are caused by flawed algorithms or logic in the program. Consequence: Syntax errors prevent the program from being compiled or interpreted, while logic errors can result in the program running indefinitely or producing incorrect output. Correction: Syntax errors can usually be easily corrected by fixing the syntax error, while logic errors may require more complex debugging and testing to identify and correct.

## javascript debugger

1. It works by enabling developers to pause the execution of their code at specific points and step through the code line by line, inspecting variables and objects as they go.
2. A breakpoint is a specific point in the source code of a program where execution is paused or halted temporarily for the purpose of debugging or troubleshooting.
3. The call stack is a data structure used by most programming languages to keep track of the execution context of a program. It is a stack of function calls that are currently in progress or waiting to be executed.
