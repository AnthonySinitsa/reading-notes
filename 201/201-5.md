# html links, js functions, and intro to css layout

## creating hyperlinks

1. to create basic link, we wrap it around in an a tag.
2. href is an html attribute used to specify URL of page that link is pointing to.
3. describe the link of what is happening, underline links, use alt text for iamges.

## css layout

1. normal flow refers to the dfault positioning and layout of html elements on a website.
2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements? Layout: Block-level elements take up the full width of their parent container and are stacked vertically on top of each other, while inline elements are laid out horizontally, one after the other, within their parent container.Size: Block-level elements have a width of 100% by default, and their height is determined by their content or any explicit height that is set in CSS. Inline elements have a width that is determined by their content, and their height is determined by the font size and line height of the surrounding text.Content: Block-level elements can contain other block-level elements and inline-level elements, while inline elements can only contain other inline-level elements or text.Box model: Block-level elements have a content box, padding box, border box, and margin box, while inline elements only have a content box and optional padding and border.Display: Some elements can be set to display as block-level or inline-level elements, depending on the display property in CSS. For example, the div element is a block-level element by default, but it can be set to display as an inline-level element using CSS. Conversely, the span element is an inline-level element by default, but it can be set to display as a block-level element using CSS.
3. static positioning is the default for every html element.
4. Exact positioning: Absolute positioning allows you to position an element exactly where you want it on the page, regardless of the surrounding elements or document flow. This can be useful when you want to create a specific layout or design that requires precise positioning. Accessibility: Absolute positioning can be used to visually hide elements from sighted users while still making them accessible to screen readers and other assistive technologies. By positioning an element offscreen or setting its opacity to 0, you can create accessible designs that meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards.
5. With absolute positioning, an element is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, which means that its position is affected by any other positioned elements that come before it in the document hierarchy. If there are no positioned ancestors, the element is positioned relative to the initial containing block, which is usually the body element.

## js functions

1. A function declaration is a statement that defines a function and its implementation, while a function invocation (also known as a function call) is a statement that calls or executes a function. A function declaration begins with the function keyword, followed by the function name, a list of parameters (enclosed in parentheses), and the function body (enclosed in curly braces). Here's an example:
2. In programming, a parameter is a named variable in a function or method definition that specifies the type and order of the values that the function or method expects to receive as input. A parameter is like a placeholder or variable in the function definition that will be replaced with actual values when the function is called. An argument, on the other hand, is a value that is passed to a function or method when it is called. Arguments are actual values that are passed to the function to replace the parameters in the function definition. The order and type of the arguments must match the parameters in the function definition, otherwise the function may not work correctly or produce errors.
