# images, color, text

## html media

1. Accessibility: Adding descriptive alternative text to images
2. Provide captions and transcripts: If an image contains important information, consider adding a caption or transcript that explains the content of the image.
3. if you have an image of a car, you want to include a caption that descibes the features of the car.
4. GIF's use lots of still images to create an animated effect. SVG's are created using vector graphics, this means they are made up of math equations and you can scale them to whatever size you want without losing quality.
5. I would want to use SVGs because the are smaller compared to GIFs. they can also be easily edited.

## css color

1. The foreground color is the color used for the text itself. The background color, on the other hand, is the color used for the area behind the text.
2. choose a color scheme, add color accents, be accessibile.
3. choose legibilty, readability, compatibility, and style when choosing fonts
4. font size: sets the size of text, font weight: sets the thickness of text, font style: sets whether the text is italic or normal.
5. Letter-spacing: This property adds space between the individual characters of the text. Word-spacing: This property adds space between words in a block of text.
