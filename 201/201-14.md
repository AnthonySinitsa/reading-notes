# css transforms and transitions

## css transformss

1. Moves an element along the X-axis and/or Y-axis. Rotates an element around a specified point. Scales an element up or down in size along the X-axis and/or Y-axis. Skews an element along the X-axis and/or Y-axis. Applies a 3D transformation to an element, giving it depth and perspective. Allows combining multiple transformations together to create complex effects.
2. let's say you have an image gallery on your website and you want to add a hover effect where the images scale up slightly when the user hovers over them.

## css transition and animations

1. With CSS transitions, developers can specify how long the transition should take, what property or properties should be animated, and how the element should behave during the transition. This allows for the creation of engaging user experiences, as elements can smoothly transition from one state to another, providing visual feedback and improving the overall interactivity and usability of a web page or application.
2. CSS animations provide more control over the timing of the animation, as you can specify the duration, delay, timing function, and iteration count for each keyframe. CSS transitions, on the other hand, have a simpler timing model, where you set the duration, delay, and timing function for the entire transition. CSS animations are typically triggered using the animation-name property, while CSS transitions are triggered when a CSS property changes value.

## css3 trasitions that will wowo you users

1. CSS transitions are relatively simple to implement, requiring only a few lines of CSS code. You can easily add animations to your website without having to write complex JavaScript code or rely on third-party libraries.  CSS transitions are responsive to changes in CSS property values, making them ideal for creating dynamic animations that respond to user interactions or changes in website content. For example, you can use CSS transitions to animate the appearance of a navigation menu, the opening and closing of an accordion, or the hover effect on buttons. CSS transitions are supported by modern web browsers, making them compatible with a wide range of devices and platforms. This ensures that your animations will work consistently across different browsers and devices, providing a consistent user experience.
