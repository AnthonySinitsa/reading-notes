## My Code Fellows reading journal

My name is Anthony, I was in a university taking computer science but the my expectations wasn't what I wanted it to be. I have heard good things about Code Fellows and wanted to do it, so I am super excited to start this path in my life.

To me Growth Mindset means to always keep a positive mental attitude and to always keep a consistent schedule of a goal you are trying to accomplish.

**3 Reminders To Stay in a Growth Mindset:**

1. Keep a positive mental attitude
2. Keep a consistent schedule
3. Having peer criticism(hopefully constructive)
