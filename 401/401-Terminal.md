# practice in the terminal

- A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text. The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands.

- nav

- pwd Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.
- ls List the contents of a directory.
- cd Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.
- Relative path A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
- Absolute path A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

- files

- file.exe - an executable file, or program.
- file.txt - a plain text file.
- file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
- Other systems such as Windows are case insensitive when it comes to referring to files. Linux is not like this. As such it is possible to have two or more files and directories with the same name but letters of different case.
- file obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
- ls -a List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.

- manual pages

- man command Look up the manual page for a particular command.
- man -k search term Do a keyword search for all manual pages containing the given search term.
- /term Within a manual page, perform a search for 'term'
- n After performing a search within a manual page, select the next found item.

- file manipulation

- mkdir Make Directory - ie. Create a directory.
- rmdir Remove Directory - ie. Delete a directory.
- touch Create a blank file.
- cp Copy - ie. Copy a file or directory.
- mv Move - ie. Move a file or directory (can also be used to rename).
- rm Remove - ie. Delete a file.
- No undo The Linux command line does not have an undo feature. Perform destructive actions carefully.
- Command line options Most commands have many useful command line options. Make sure you skim the man page for new commands so you are familiar with what they can do and what is available.
