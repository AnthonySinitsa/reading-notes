1. Arrow Functions: Arrow functions are a more concise syntax for defining functions in JavaScript. They provide a more intuitive and shorter way to write function expressions. The syntax allows developers to avoid explicit function keyword, curly braces, and return statements in certain cases, making the code cleaner and easier to read.

2. In Tailwind CSS, utility classes are a key feature that allows you to rapidly style HTML elements by applying pre-defined classes directly to the markup. Instead of writing custom CSS for every element, you can use these utility classes to achieve a wide range of styles and layouts quickly. The purpose of utility classes is to provide a modular and efficient way of styling elements without writing any custom CSS. Tailwind CSS comes with an extensive set of utility classes, such as margins, paddings, typography, colors, flexbox, and more. These classes are designed to be highly composable and can be combined to create complex designs without leaving your HTML file.

3. Server-side rendering (SSR): One of the most significant benefits of Next.js is its built-in support for server-side rendering. SSR allows web pages to be rendered on the server before being sent to the client's browser. This results in faster initial page loads and improved search engine optimization (SEO) as search engine crawlers can easily read the fully rendered content. This is particularly beneficial for content-heavy websites and applications. Improved performance and user experience: Next.js optimizes the loading process through features like automatic code splitting and lazy loading. Automatic code splitting ensures that only the necessary JavaScript and CSS files are loaded for each page, reducing the initial loading time. Lazy loading allows components and assets to be loaded asynchronously, making the page feel faster and more responsive to users.
