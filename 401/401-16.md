1. No Server Management: In serverless computing, developers are relieved from the burden of server management tasks such as server provisioning, scaling, patching, and maintenance. The cloud provider takes care of these responsibilities, allowing developers to focus solely on writing code. Event-driven Architecture: Serverless platforms are typically event-driven, meaning they respond to events or triggers. Functions are executed in response to events such as HTTP requests, database changes, file uploads, or timer-based intervals. This event-driven architecture enables highly scalable and flexible applications.

2. Connect your project to Vercel, Initialize your project, Configure project settings: During the initialization process, you'll be prompted to configure your project settings, such as the framework you're using and the build command. Follow the prompts and provide the necessary information.

3. Start by reading the API documentation to understand its endpoints, request parameters, and response formats. The documentation usually provides information about how to authenticate and make requests to the API. Python provides several libraries for making HTTP requests, such as requests, httplib, or urllib. Choose a library that suits your needs and install it if necessary. Once you receive a response from the API, you'll need to parse and process the data returned. Most APIs return data in formats like JSON or XML. Python provides built-in libraries like json and xml.etree.ElementTree for handling these formats.

4. To use the Requests library, you first need to install it, import the library, The Requests library supports various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. In the context of interacting with APIs, you would typically use GET requests to retrieve data from the API.

        import requests

        # Make a GET request to a URL
        response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")

        # Check the response status code
        if response.status_code == 200:
            # Successful request
            data = response.json()  # Parse the response as JSON
            print(data)
        else:
            # Request was not successful
            print("Request failed with status code:", response.status_code)
