- A linked list is a data structure composed of nodes that are connected to each other. Each node in the linked list contains a reference to the next node in the sequence. The two main types of linked lists are singly linked lists and doubly linked lists. In this explanation, we will focus on singly linked lists. Linked List: A data structure that contains nodes linked to each other. Node: Represents an individual item in a linked list and contains data and a reference to the next node. Next: A property of each node that holds the reference to the next node in the linked list. Head: A reference to the first node in the linked list. Current: A reference to the node currently being processed or examined during traversal. To traverse a linked list, we typically use a while loop. This loop continues as long as the next node is not null, ensuring that we are still within the linked list. We start traversal by assigning the current variable to the head, guaranteeing that we begin from the beginning of the linked list.
