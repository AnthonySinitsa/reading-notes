# data visualization

1. Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a powerful and flexible library for creating static, two-dimensional visualizations. It provides a wide range of plotting functions and a high level of customization. It is the foundation for many other libraries and is highly customizable, allowing users to control every aspect of their plots. Seaborn: Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a higher-level interface for creating statistical graphics. It focuses on visualizing statistical relationships and is designed to work well with pandas dataframes. Seaborn offers a wide variety of aesthetically pleasing predefined color palettes and statistical plotting functions. Bokeh: Bokeh is a library specifically designed for interactive, browser-based visualizations. It targets modern web browsers and allows users to create interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications. Bokeh provides a high-level interface to create interactive visualizations with JavaScript-like interactions.

2. Relational plots: scatterplot(): This function creates a scatter plot, which displays the relationship between two continuous variables. It is useful for visualizing patterns or correlations between variables. For example, it can be used to examine the relationship between a person's age and their income. Categorical plots: barplot(): This function creates a bar plot, which represents categorical data with rectangular bars. It is commonly used to compare the values of different categories. For example, it can be used to compare the average scores of students from different schools. countplot(): This function creates a count plot, which shows the count of occurrences of each category in a categorical variable. It is useful for visualizing the distribution of categorical data. For example, it can be used to display the frequency of different types of cars in a dataset. Distribution plots: histplot(): This function creates a histogram, which represents the distribution of a continuous variable by dividing it into bins and displaying the frequency or count of data points in each bin. It is commonly used to visualize the distributional shape of a dataset. For example, it can be used to analyze the distribution of students' test scores. kdeplot(): This function creates a kernel density estimate plot, which provides a smooth estimate of the distribution of a continuous variable. It is useful for examining the shape and density of the data. For example, it can be used to visualize the probability density of heights in a population.

3. Importing Seaborn and setting the default style: This section provides the basic code snippet for importing the Seaborn library and setting the default style. It ensures that all subsequent visualizations adhere to a consistent aesthetic. Data manipulation: This section covers various Seaborn functions for manipulating data, such as reordering categorical variables, converting long-form data to wide-form, and computing correlations between variables. Plotting functions: The cheat sheet includes a range of plotting functions available in Seaborn, each with a brief description. These functions cover different types of plots, including scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, histograms, box plots, violin plots, heatmaps, and more.
