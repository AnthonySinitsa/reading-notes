1. Depth First:

- Depth first traversal prioritizes going through the depth (height) of the tree first.

- There are three common methods for depth first traversal:

- Pre-order: Visit the root, then recursively traverse the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.

- In-order: Recursively traverse the left subtree, visit the root, and then traverse the right subtree.

- Post-order: Recursively traverse the left subtree, traverse the right subtree, and finally visit the root.

2. Breadth First:

- Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree level by level, visiting all the nodes at each level before moving to the next level.

3. Binary Tree Vs K-ary Trees:

- In a binary tree, each node can have at most two children, a left child, and a right child. There is no specific sorting order for nodes in a binary tree.

- K-ary trees are generalizations of binary trees, where each node can have up to k children. The value of k determines the maximum number of children a node can have.

4. Binary Search Trees (BST):

- A binary search tree is a type of binary tree with an additional constraint: for each node, the values in its left subtree are smaller than its value, and the values in its right subtree are larger.

- The structure of a BST allows for efficient searching. When searching for a value, we compare it with the root and traverse left or right based on the comparison until we find the desired node or reach a leaf.

5. Adding a Node:

- Adding a node to a binary tree can be done anywhere as there are no specific rules for node placement. One strategy is to use breadth first traversal and insert the node as a child in the first node encountered that has available child spots.

6. Big O Complexity:

- The time complexity for operations on a binary tree is generally O(n), where n is the number of nodes. This is because in the worst case, we may need to visit all the nodes in the tree.

- The space complexity for binary tree operations is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case, a tree can be skewed, resulting in a height of n, leading to O(n) space complexity.

- For binary search trees, the time complexity for search and insertion operations is O(h), where h is the height of the tree.
