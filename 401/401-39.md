# react 3

1. Creating Context: First, you define a context using the React.createContext() method. This creates a new context object with two components: the Provider and the Consumer. Providing Data: The data you want to share is provided by wrapping the components that need access to this data with the MyContext.Provider component. The Provider component takes a value prop that specifies the data to be shared.

2. Create a React Context First, you need to create a React Context using the createContext function. This function returns a Context object that includes a Provider and a Consumer. The Provider is used to wrap the part of the component tree where you want to share the context data, and the Consumer is used to access that data. Provide the Context in a Parent Component Wrap the part of your component tree where you want to share the context data with a Provider component. Pass the data you want to share as the value prop of the Provider.

3. Server-side Rendering (SSR): Next.js allows rendering React components on the server side before sending them to the client. This provides several advantages, such as improved performance, search engine optimization, and better initial load times. Static Site Generation (SSG): Next.js supports static site generation, which means you can pre-render pages at build time and serve them as static HTML files. This is ideal for content-based websites that do not require real-time data. Automatic Code Splitting: Next.js automatically splits your JavaScript bundles based on the pages you create. This results in optimized loading times, as users only download the code they need for a specific page.
