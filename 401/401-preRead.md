1. Pushing beyond your comfort zone: To make progress, you need to tackle challenges that are slightly more difficult than what you're comfortable with. It's crucial to identify the knowledge gap and overcome it gradually. Regular repetition: Repeating the same type of problem or skill helps you gain proficiency and apply it in different contexts. Practice should be consistent and frequent. Continuous feedback: In programming, the correctness of your code provides immediate feedback. However, it's important to seek feedback on subjective aspects as well, such as code quality, readability, and security.

It should push you to think deeply, forcing you to use your problem-solving skills and expanding your knowledge. Clear goals: Set specific goals that enable you to learn something new. The focus should be on the learning process rather than the end result.
