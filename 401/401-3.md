# fileIO and Exceptions

1. Automatic file opening: The with statement automatically opens the specified file for you, eliminating the need to explicitly call the open() function and remember to close the file later. It ensures that the file is properly opened and available for operations within the indented block.

2. read(): The read() method reads the entire content of a file or a specified number of bytes and returns it as a single string. It takes an optional argument that specifies the number of bytes to read. If no argument is provided, it reads the entire file. When using read(), the file pointer moves to the end of the file after reading.

        file = open('example.txt', 'r')
        content = file.read()
        print(content)
        file.close()

3. readline(): The readline() method reads a single line from a file and returns it as a string. It reads characters until it encounters a newline character ('\n') or reaches the end of the file. Successive calls to readline() will return subsequent lines. When using readline(), the file pointer moves to the beginning of the next line after reading.

        file = open('example.txt', 'r')
        line1 = file.readline()
        print(line1)

        line2 = file.readline()
        print(line2)
        file.close()

4. Exception handling in Python allows you to handle and recover from errors that occur during the execution of your code. It provides a way to gracefully handle exceptions and prevent your program from crashing.

        try:
            # Code that might raise an exception
            num1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
            num2 = int(input("Enter another number: "))
            result = num1 / num2
            print("Result:", result)

        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.")

        except ZeroDivisionError:
            print("Cannot divide by zero!")

        finally:
            print("Exception handling is complete.")
