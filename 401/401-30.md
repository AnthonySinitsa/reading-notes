# hash tables

A Hashtable, also known as a Hash Map, is a data structure used for efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval. It is based on the concept of hashing, where keys are converted into unique numerical values called hash codes. These hash codes are used as indices in an array (or sometimes, in more advanced implementations, in a data structure with fast access time) to store and retrieve the associated values.

Terminology:

Hash: A hash is the result of an algorithm that takes an incoming string (the key) and converts it into a numerical value (hash code). The hash code is used to determine the index of the array where the key-value pair will be stored.

Buckets: In the context of a Hashtable, buckets are the individual slots or locations in the array. Each index of the array is a bucket. If a collision occurs (i.e., multiple keys hash to the same index), a bucket may contain multiple key-value pairs linked together in a data structure such as a linked list.

Collisions: A collision occurs when two or more different keys produce the same hash code, leading to the same index in the array. Collisions are managed by various collision resolution techniques to ensure proper storage and retrieval of key-value pairs.

Why do we use Hashtables?

Hashtables are used for various purposes, primarily for their ability to provide fast access and retrieval of data based on keys. Some common use cases include:

Holding unique values: Hashtables are used to store unique elements, where the keys act as identifiers.

Dictionary: They are used as dictionary-like data structures to associate words or identifiers (keys) with their meanings or values.

Library: In programming, Hashtables are used to implement libraries or caches, where functions, objects, or data can be stored and retrieved quickly.

Structure and Working of Hashtables:

Hashing: When a key-value pair is added to the Hashtable, the key is passed through a hashing algorithm to generate a unique hash code. The hash code determines the index in the array where the key-value pair will be stored.

Storing key-value pairs: The key and value are stored together in a bucket. If a collision occurs, and another key hashes to the same index, a collision resolution technique is used to handle the situation. Common resolution techniques include chaining (using linked lists) or open addressing.

Retrieval: To retrieve a value based on a key, the same hash code calculation is performed on the key to find the corresponding index. If a collision has occurred, the algorithm traverses the data structure in the bucket (e.g., linked list) to find the correct key-value pair.
