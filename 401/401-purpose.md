MAKE ROOM FOR WHAT YOU LOVE

MAXIMIZE

1. Continuous Learning and Skill Development: To stay updated in the ever-evolving tech world and to innovate, one should constantly learn, be it through courses, bootcamps, or self-study.

1. Collaborative Opportunities: This includes open-source contributions, team projects, and networking events. Collaboration not only helps in skill enhancement but also fosters the sharing of diverse perspectives and ideas.

1. Ethical Coding Practices: Prioritize the understanding and implementation of ethical coding. This means being transparent about how data is used, ensuring security, and adhering to best practices that protect user rights.

MINIMIZE

1. Isolation in Work: While independent projects are beneficial, avoid working in complete isolation. Engaging with a community or team can provide valuable feedback, different perspectives, and growth opportunities.

1. Shortcuts and Quick Fixes: In the realm of software development, shortcuts can lead to security vulnerabilities, poor performance, or unexpected bugs. Prioritize quality and long-term stability over quick, temporary fixes.

1. Distractions and Non-relevant Tasks: Time is precious. Minimize activities or engagements that don't align with your purpose or that divert you from your core values and goals. This includes excessive consumption of unrelated content, involvement in unrelated projects, or any other task that doesn't serve your purpose.
