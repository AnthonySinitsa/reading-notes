# automation

1. Regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern matching and string manipulation, but they can also be complex. If you're new to regular expressions, it's recommended to study the syntax and practice with examples to become familiar with their usage. The Python documentation and various online tutorials can provide further guidance on using regular expressions with the re module.

2. The shutil (short for "shell utilities") library in Python provides a set of high-level file and directory management operations. It offers functions for copying files and directories, removing files and directories, and other related operations. One common use case for the shutil library is when you need to copy or move files or directories. Besides copying and moving files, the shutil library provides functions for various other operations, such as removing directories (shutil.rmtree()), copying file permissions and metadata (shutil.copy2()), creating archive files (shutil.make_archive()), and more. It is a versatile library for file and directory management tasks in Python.

3. ne automation idea that can be implemented using Python's regular expressions and shutil libraries is a file sorting and organizing system. This automation idea involves writing a Python script that scans a specified directory, identifies files with specific patterns in their names, and moves them to designated folders based on those patterns.

        import re
        import shutil
        import os

        pattern1 = r'^document_\d+\.txt$'  # Matches files with names like "document_1.txt"
        pattern2 = r'^image_\d+\.jpg$'     # Matches files with names like "image_2.jpg"
        pattern3 = r'^data_\d+\.csv$'      # Matches files with names like "data_3.csv"

        source_directory = '/path/to/source/directory'
        destination_directory1 = '/path/to/destination/directory1'
        destination_directory2 = '/path/to/destination/directory2'
        destination_directory3 = '/path/to/destination/directory3'

        for filename in os.listdir(source_directory):
            source_file = os.path.join(source_directory, filename)
            
            # Match the filename against the regular expressions
            if re.match(pattern1, filename):
                destination = destination_directory1
            elif re.match(pattern2, filename):
                destination = destination_directory2
            elif re.match(pattern3, filename):
                destination = destination_directory3
            else:
                continue  # Skip files that don't match any pattern
            
            # Move the file to the appropriate destination directory
            shutil.move(source_file, destination)
