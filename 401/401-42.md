# Pythonisms

1. Dunder methods, short for "double underscore methods" but often referred to as "magic methods" or "special methods," are special Python methods with names surrounded by double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__, __add__). These methods provide a way to customize the behavior of built-in operations and functionalities for objects of user-defined classes. By implementing dunder methods in your classes, you can make instances of your classes behave like built-in Python types and respond to specific operators and functions.

2. __iter__() method: This method returns the iterator object itself. It is called when you use the iter() function on an object. This method is responsible for initializing and setting up the necessary state to iterate over the collection. __next__() method: This method returns the next element in the collection. It is called when you use the next() function on the iterator object. When there are no more elements to return, this method raises the StopIteration exception to signal the end of iteration.

3. In Python, a generator is a type of function that allows you to create iterators. It produces a sequence of values using the yield keyword instead of the return keyword. Generators are memory-efficient and provide a way to iterate over large datasets or infinite sequences without loading all the values into memory at once. The main difference between a generator and a regular function is that a regular function returns a single value and is executed entirely at once, while a generator function can pause its execution and return multiple values over time. When a generator is called, it returns an iterator object, and the actual code inside the generator is executed only when the iterator's next() method is called.

4. In Python, decorators are a powerful feature that allows you to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods without changing their actual code. Decorators are essentially functions that take another function (or method) as an argument and return a new function that usually extends or enhances the behavior of the original function. They provide a way to wrap or "decorate" functions with additional functionality.
