# random modules

1. Generating random numbers:

- random.random(): Returns a random float between 0 and 1.
- random.randint(a, b): Returns a random integer between a and b (inclusive).
- random.uniform(a, b): Returns a random float between a and b.

2. Making selections from a list:

- random.choice(sequence): Returns a random element from the given sequence, which can be a list, tuple, or string.
- random.sample(sequence, k): Returns a list of k unique random elements from the given sequence.
- random.shuffle(sequence): Shuffles the elements in the given sequence in-place.

3. Risk Identification: Identify and document potential risks that could impact the project. This can be done through brainstorming sessions, reviewing historical data, analyzing similar projects, and involving project stakeholders.

4. Identifying untested areas: Test coverage helps in identifying portions of code that have not been executed by any tests. This information is valuable as it highlights potential gaps in the test suite, indicating areas that may be prone to defects. Measuring test completeness: Test coverage provides a quantitative measure of how thoroughly the code has been tested. Higher coverage implies a greater level of confidence that the code behaves as expected.

5. The Big O notation is written as O(f(n)), where 'f(n)' represents the growth rate function and 'n' denotes the input size. It characterizes the worst-case scenario or the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity.

- O(1): Constant time complexity. The algorithm's runtime remains constant, regardless of the input size.
- O(log n): Logarithmic time complexity. The algorithm's runtime grows logarithmically with the input size.
- O(n): Linear time complexity. The algorithm's runtime grows linearly with the input size.
- O(n^2): Quadratic time complexity. The algorithm's runtime grows quadratically with the input size.
- O(2^n): Exponential time complexity. The algorithm's runtime grows exponentially with the input size.
