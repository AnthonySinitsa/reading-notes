# stacks and queues

Stacks and queues are two common data structures used in computer science and programming. They have different characteristics and follow specific rules for adding and removing elements.

Stack:

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
Elements are added and removed from the same end, called the "top" of the stack.
Common operations on a stack are:
Push: Adding an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removing the top element from the stack.
Peek: Viewing the value of the top element without removing it.
IsEmpty: Checking if the stack is empty.
Examples of real-life stacks include a stack of plates or a call stack in programming.
Stack visualization: Elements are stacked one on top of another, with the topmost element being the most recently added one.
Queue:

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
Elements are added at one end, called the "rear," and removed from the other end, called the "front" of the queue.
Common operations on a queue are:
Enqueue: Adding an element to the rear of the queue.
Dequeue: Removing the front element from the queue.
Peek: Viewing the value of the front element without removing it.
IsEmpty: Checking if the queue is empty.
Examples of real-life queues include a line of people waiting for a bus or a printer queue.

Queue:

Elements are arranged in a linear manner, with the front and rear positions clearly defined.
In both stacks and queues, the operations for adding or removing elements are typically efficient, with a time complexity of O(1). This means that the time it takes to perform the operations does not depend on the number of elements already present in the data structure.

It's important to note that there are different ways to implement stacks and queues, such as using arrays or linked lists. The examples provided in the explanation use linked list implementations, where each element (node) holds a reference to the next element in the structure.
