# linear regressions

1. The basic concept of linear regression involves fitting a line (in the case of simple linear regression with one independent variable) or a hyperplane (in the case of multiple linear regression with multiple independent variables) to the data points in such a way that the distance between the line/hyperplane and the actual data points is minimized. This line/hyperplane represents the best linear approximation of the relationship between the variables.

2. you need to load and prepare your data for training the linear regression model. This typically involves loading the dataset, separating the features (input variables) from the target variable (output variable), and splitting the data into training and testing sets. create an instance of the LinearRegression class and train it using the training data. Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data. In this case, you can use the testing set that was separated earlier.

3. Model Training: The train set is used to train the model by feeding it with input data and their corresponding target labels. During training, the model learns patterns and relationships within the data, optimizing its internal parameters to make accurate predictions. Model Evaluation: Once the model is trained, it is crucial to evaluate its performance on unseen data to assess how well it can generalize. This is where the test set comes into play. The test set contains data that the model has not seen during training, providing an independent sample to evaluate the model's performance. Performance Metrics: By using the test set, various performance metrics are calculated to measure how well the model performs on unseen data. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and others depending on the specific problem domain. These metrics help quantify the model's predictive abilities and provide insights into its strengths and weaknesses.
