# graphs

Vertex/Node: A data object within the graph that represents an entity. Each vertex can have zero or more adjacent vertices connected to it by edges.

Edge: A connection between two vertices that signifies a relationship or interaction between them.

Neighbor: The adjacent vertices of a node that are connected to it by edges.

Degree: The number of edges connected to a vertex. In the case of a directed graph, it can be split into indegree (incoming edges) and outdegree (outgoing edges).

Graphs can be categorized into two main types based on the presence or absence of direction in edges:

Undirected Graph: Each edge is undirected or bidirectional, meaning there is no specific direction associated with the connections.

Directed Graph (Digraph): Each edge is directed from one vertex to another, indicating a one-way relationship.

Graphs can further be classified based on their connectivity:

Complete Graph: A graph where every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex.

Connected Graph: A graph where all vertices have at least one edge, and there is a path between any pair of vertices.

Disconnected Graph: A graph where some vertices may not have any edges, resulting in isolated components.

Graphs can also be characterized by their cyclic or acyclic nature:

Acyclic Graph: A directed graph with no cycles, meaning there are no loops that lead back to a vertex itself.

Cyclic Graph: A graph that contains cycles, where a sequence of edges can lead back to the starting vertex.

Graphs can be represented using two common methods:

Adjacency Matrix: A 2D matrix representing the graph, where each cell (i, j) is 1 if there is an edge between vertices i and j, and 0 if there is no edge.

Adjacency List: A collection of linked lists or arrays, where each vertex has a list of its adjacent vertices.

Graphs can be weighted or unweighted, depending on whether the edges have associated weights or not. Weighted graphs are used when there is a numerical value assigned to each edge, representing some metric or cost between vertices.

Traversal is an essential operation on graphs:

Breadth-First Traversal: Visits all nodes at the same level before moving to the next level. Implemented using a queue.

Depth-First Traversal: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Implemented using a stack (recursive function calls in the case of trees).

Graphs have a wide range of applications, including GPS and mapping systems, social networks, recommendation systems, network routing, and much more. Understanding graphs and their various representations and algorithms is crucial in computer science and data science.
