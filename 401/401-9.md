1. Dunder methods, also known as special methods or magic methods, in Python are a set of predefined methods that provide a way to define and customize the behavior of objects. These methods are surrounded by double underscores (dunders) at the beginning and end of their names, hence the name "dunder methods." They allow objects to respond to specific operators, built-in functions, and syntax constructs in Python.

2. The Python statistics module is a built-in module that provides a set of functions for mathematical statistics operations. It allows you to perform various statistical computations on data sets, including measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, correlation analysis, and more. The module is part of the standard library in Python, so it does not require any additional installation.
