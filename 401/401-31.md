# django REST framework and docker

1. Docker Image: The Docker image is the core component of a container. It is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that contains all the necessary code, runtime, libraries, tools, and settings required to run an application. Docker images are built from a set of instructions provided in a Dockerfile, which defines the base image and the steps to install and configure the application and its dependencies. Docker Engine: The Docker Engine is the runtime that enables the creation and execution of Docker containers. It includes the Docker daemon, which manages the containers, and a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with Docker. Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a plain text file that contains a set of instructions for building a Docker image. It defines the base image, sets up the environment, installs dependencies, copies application code, and configures the container. Dockerfiles are version-controlled and can be shared, allowing consistent and reproducible builds across different environments.

2. Set up Django Project and App: Install Django and create a new Django project using the command: django-admin startproject project_name. Create a new app within the project using the command: python manage.py startapp app_name. Define Models: Models represent the data structure of your application. For a library website, you might have models like Book, Author, Genre, and LibraryBranch. Define these models in the models.py file of your app. For example, the Book model may have fields like title, author, genre, publication_date, and available_copies. Create Database Tables: After defining the models, create the corresponding database tables using migrations.

3. Django: Django is a high-level web framework that enables rapid development of web applications. It follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern and comes with built-in features for handling database operations, URL routing, templating, authentication, and more. Django is excellent for building full-stack web applications that include frontend and backend components. Django REST framework (DRF): DRF is an extension of Django specifically designed for building Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It provides additional tools and abstractions to make it easy to create APIs that can handle various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and respond with serialized data (often in JSON or XML format). DRF is best suited for developing RESTful APIs to be consumed by frontend frameworks or mobile applications.
