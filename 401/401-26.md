# intro to Django

1. Models: Models define the structure and behavior of data in the application. They are Python classes that map to database tables. Models define fields, relationships, and various methods to interact with the data. Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) allows developers to work with the database using Python code, eliminating the need for direct SQL queries. Views: Views handle the logic behind each web page or API endpoint. They receive requests from users, retrieve data from models or other sources, and return responses. Views can render HTML templates to generate dynamic web pages or return data in different formats (e.g., JSON) for API endpoints.

2. View: The View component handles the logic and processing of the incoming web request. It interacts with the Model to fetch and manipulate the data required for the response. Views can be simple functions or class-based views, and they perform tasks such as retrieving data from the database, applying business logic, and preparing the data for rendering. Template: The Template component is responsible for rendering the data obtained from the View into a presentable format, typically HTML. Templates are separate files that contain a mix of HTML and Django's template language, which provides powerful features like conditional statements, loops, and variable substitution. Templates define the structure and layout of the final output that will be sent as the response.

3. The purpose of Tailwind CSS is to provide a utility-first CSS framework that gives developers low-level building blocks to create custom designs. Instead of pre-designed components, Tailwind CSS focuses on providing a comprehensive set of utility classes that can be combined to style HTML elements. These utility classes enable developers to quickly style their components by applying classes directly to the HTML markup. Tailwind CSS provides a large set of utility classes for spacing, typography, colors, flexbox, grids, and more, allowing developers to easily customize and design their UIs.
