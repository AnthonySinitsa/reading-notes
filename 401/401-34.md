# API deployment

1. Separation of Concerns: Divide your settings into multiple files based on their concerns. This can be achieved by creating different settings files for different environments (development, production, staging, etc.), or by categorizing settings based on their purpose (e.g., database settings, logging settings, etc.). Environment Variables: Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like secret keys, passwords, and API keys directly in your settings files. Instead, use environment variables to store and access such sensitive information. This helps keep your sensitive data out of version control and provides an added layer of security. Use Default Settings: Whenever possible, use default settings provided by Django. This ensures that you follow Django's conventions and reduces the chances of misconfigurations.

2. Efficient Static File Serving: WhiteNoise serves static files directly from the application's codebase, avoiding the need for a separate server (like Nginx or Apache) to handle static files. This can reduce the complexity of your deployment and make it easier to manage the application. Gzip Compression: WhiteNoise can automatically compress static files using gzip encoding. This reduces the file size and results in faster loading times for users. Caching: The library integrates with Django's caching framework, allowing you to cache static files in memory. This minimizes the need for repeated file access and improves response times. Automatic Handling of Manifest Files: WhiteNoise can automatically handle static file name changes that might occur during version updates. This is especially useful when using tools like Webpack or other asset bundlers that generate hashed filenames.

3. Origin: When a web application makes a cross-origin request, the browser sends an "Origin" header along with the request, indicating the origin (protocol, domain, and port) of the requesting web application. Preflight Request (Optional): For certain types of cross-origin requests (e.g., with custom headers, or non-simple HTTP methods like PUT or DELETE), the browser sends a preflight request (using the HTTP OPTIONS method) to the server to check if the actual request is safe to send. The server must respond to this preflight request with appropriate CORS headers.
