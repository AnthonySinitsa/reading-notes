# django models

1. The purpose of Django models is to define the database schema and manage the interaction between the application and the database. By defining models, you can create tables in the database, specify fields and their data types, define relationships between tables, and perform various database operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records.

2. Automatic CRUD Operations: The Admin interface automatically generates forms and views for performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on the models defined in your Django project. Model-driven Interface: The Admin interface reflects the structure of your Django models, providing a user-friendly way to interact with the data stored in the database. Authentication and Permissions: The Admin interface integrates seamlessly with Django's authentication and permission system. It supports user authentication, authorization, and the ability to assign different permissions to different users.

3. A client makes an HTTP request to a specific URL handled by the Django application. The URL dispatcher receives the request and matches it to the corresponding view function or class based on the defined URL patterns. The view function or class processes the request, retrieves necessary data from the database using models, and performs any required computations. If necessary, the view passes data to a template, which generates the HTML response dynamically by rendering the data using template tags and variables.
