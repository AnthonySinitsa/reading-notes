1. Static Routes: Static routes are the traditional routes commonly used in web applications. When you create a static route, it means that the content associated with that route is generated at build time and remains the same until the next build. This approach is suitable for pages whose content does not change frequently or is not dependent on external data. For example, if you have a blog website with a static route like /blog, the content of the /blog page will be generated during the build process. This content will be consistent for all users until the next build, regardless of individual user interactions or data changes. Pros of Static Routes: Faster load times: Since the content is pre-generated during the build, it can be served quickly to users. Better SEO: Static content is easily crawlable by search engines, improving search engine optimization.
Cons of Static Routes: Limited dynamic content: Any dynamic content requires additional server-side logic or client-side JavaScript to fetch and display updated data.

2. Prepare your Next.js application: Before deploying, ensure that your Next.js application is production-ready. Optimize the code, remove any debug statements, and test it thoroughly to ensure it functions as expected. Choose a Hosting Provider: Decide on the hosting provider or deployment platform where you want to deploy your Next.js application. There are several options available, ranging from traditional web hosting services to cloud platforms. Static vs. Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Next.js supports both static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR). Choose the rendering method that best suits your application's needs. For static sites, your deployment process will be simpler, whereas SSR may require a more complex setup.

3. pages: This is where you create your dynamic and static page components. Next.js automatically generates routes based on the files inside this folder. public: This is the default folder for storing static assets like images, fonts, stylesheets, and other files that need to be directly accessible by the client-side.
