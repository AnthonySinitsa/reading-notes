1. Flexible layout: Jupyter Lab provides a customizable and modular user interface. You can arrange different panels, such as the notebook editor, file browser, console, and plots, in a way that suits your workflow. This flexibility enables you to create a personalized environment tailored to your specific needs. File browser: Jupyter Lab includes a built-in file browser that allows you to navigate and manage your files and directories without leaving the IDE. You can easily create, delete, rename, and move files, making it convenient for organizing your project files. Code console: Jupyter Lab provides an interactive code console where you can execute code snippets or run commands in a separate Python interpreter session. This feature is useful for experimenting with code, debugging, and exploring data interactively. Jupyter Lab offers a more comprehensive and versatile IDE experience. While Jupyter Notebook primarily focuses on providing a web-based interface for creating and running Jupyter notebooks, Jupyter Lab expands on this foundation by introducing a modular and extensible architecture.

2. Multi-dimensional arrays: NumPy's ndarray is an efficient container for multi-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types. It allows you to represent and manipulate arrays with any number of dimensions. This functionality is crucial for tasks involving matrices, vectors, and multi-dimensional data. Broadcasting: Broadcasting is a powerful feature of NumPy that allows operations to be performed on arrays with different shapes. NumPy automatically broadcasts the smaller array to match the shape of the larger array, eliminating the need for explicit loops and making computations more concise and efficient.

3. Array Creation: NumPy arrays can be created using various methods. Some common approaches include: Creating an array from a Python list:

        import numpy as np
        my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        my_array = np.array(my_list)

Array Operations: NumPy provides a wide range of operations to manipulate arrays efficiently. Some examples include: Arithmetic operations:

        import numpy as np
        a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
        b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
        c = a + b        # Element-wise addition
        d = a * 2        # Scalar multiplication
