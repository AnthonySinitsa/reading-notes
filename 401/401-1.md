1. Mental Challenges: Beginners may struggle with understanding fundamental programming concepts, syntax, and the logic behind Python code. They may find it difficult to think through and solve problems. Overwhelm: The sheer amount of information and resources available for learning Python can be overwhelming for beginners. It may be challenging to know where to start or which resources to follow.

2. Time complexity refers to the amount of time or number of operations required by an algorithm to solve a problem as a function of the input size. It provides an estimate of how the algorithm's execution time increases with larger input sizes. Time complexity is typically expressed using Big O notation. It describes the worst-case scenario, indicating the upper bound on the running time of the algorithm. It helps us understand how the algorithm's performance scales as the input size grows.

3. When you modify an immutable data type, a new object is created with the updated value. The original object remains unchanged. Mutable data types can be modified after creation.
