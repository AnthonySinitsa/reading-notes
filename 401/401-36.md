1. Communicate Clearly: Engage with the interviewer throughout the interview process. Don't immediately start solving the problem; instead, take some important steps before diving into the solution. Restate the Question: Make sure you understand the problem by restating it to the interviewer and seeking affirmation. This helps clarify any misunderstandings and gives you time to think. Ask About Edge Cases: Before coding, consider potential edge cases related to the inputs and outputs of the problem. Ask the interviewer about these cases to demonstrate your analytical skills. Ask About Test Cases: Inquire if there are any specific test cases that your code should pass. This shows your familiarity with testing and attention to detail.

2. Practice Whiteboard Coding, Think Aloud and Communicate, Understand the Problem, Break Down the Problem, Use Examples and Test Cases, Manage Your Time, Review and Optimize

3. Technical Skills: Preparing for technical interviews is crucial. Focus on data structures, algorithms, problem-solving, and coding. Practice solving coding challenges and whiteboard problems. Problem-Solving Strategies: Learn effective problem-solving strategies, including understanding the problem, devising a plan, and explaining your thought process while solving the problem. Communication Skills: It's not just about getting the right answer; it's also essential to communicate your thought process clearly and concisely. Practice explaining your approach and reasoning during interviews. Mock Interviews: Conduct mock interviews with friends, colleagues, or through professional coaching services. These practice sessions can help simulate real interview scenarios and provide valuable feedback.
