1. new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]

        numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

        print(squared_numbers)

2. In Python, a decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a modified version of it. The modified version of the function can have additional functionality added to it, or it can be modified in some other way.

3. The basic idea behind decorators is that they take in a function as an argument, perform some additional processing or modify its behavior, and then return a new function or callable object that can be used in place of the original function. This allows you to add functionality to functions or classes transparently, without modifying their code.
