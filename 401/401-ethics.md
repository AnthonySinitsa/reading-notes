1. The cubersecurity rish of self-driving cars - The article discusses the cybersecurity risks associated with self-driving cars. While proponents see potential benefits in terms of economic productivity and reduced urban congestion, concerns have been raised about the vulnerability of these vehicles to cyberattacks. The susceptibility of self-driving cars to hackers depends on factors such as their level of connectivity and reliance on external sensors for decision-making. Given the complexity of software and the potential for bugs to create security vulnerabilities, experts warn that any computerized system with an interface to the outside world is potentially hackable. Car manufacturers are actively working on defense techniques to protect their systems from attacks, but past research has already demonstrated successful hacks against some carmakers. Government regulators have released guidelines and made cybersecurity a part of the safety assessment for autonomous vehicles. However, solely relying on regulation might not be sufficient, as testing and certifying the security of complex systems are challenging. Startups are also entering the security market to address the issue, but caution is advised, as the industry is prone to over-promising without delivering effective solutions.

2. Amazon Workers Demand Jeff Bezos Cancel Face Recognition Contracts With Law Enforcemint - Amazon employees are circulating an internal letter to CEO Jeff Bezos, urging him to stop selling the company's Rekognition facial recognition software to law enforcement and terminate the data-mining firm Palantir from its cloud services. The protests were sparked by objections to the Trump administration's "zero-tolerance" policy at the U.S. border, which resulted in the separation of children from their parents. The American Civil Liberties Union revealed that Amazon had actively marketed its Rekognition software to police departments, raising concerns about its potential misuse for surveillance and violation of civil rights, particularly targeting immigrants and people of color. The letter follows employee activism at other tech giants like Microsoft and Google, demonstrating a growing trend of tech employees speaking up against work they consider unethical.
