# putting it all together

1. use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the single responsibility principle, that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

2. To build a static version of your app that renders your data model,

3. don’t use state at all to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don’t need it.

4. Does it change over time?

- Is it specific to a component?

- Can it be derived from props or other state?

5. Identify the data that a component needs to render: Look at the data that a component uses to render its content. If this data changes over time, then it's a good candidate for state.

- Determine if the data is specific to the component: If the data is specific to a particular component and not shared by other components, then it should be stored in the component's state.

- Check if the data is used by child components: If the data is used by child components, then it should be stored in the parent component's state and passed down as props to the child components.

## high order functions

1. Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.

2. if m is greater than n then return m   boolean

3. Map is a higher-order function that takes a function and a collection as inputs, and applies the function to each element in the collection, returning a new collection with the transformed elements. The original collection remains unchanged. higher-order function that takes a function and a collection as inputs, and applies the function to the elements of the collection in a cumulative way, producing a single result.
