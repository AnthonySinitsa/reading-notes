# APIs

1. REST stands for Representational State Transfer.

2. REST APIs are designed around resources

3. example: https://adventure-works.com/orders/1

4. The most common operations are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

5. URIs should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource).

6. https://adventure-works.com/orders // Good

7. Another factor is that all web requests impose a load on the web server. The more requests, the bigger the load. Therefore, try to avoid "chatty" web APIs that expose a large number of small resources. They are not a good thing
