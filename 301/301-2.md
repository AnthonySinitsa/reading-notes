# state and props

1. Render happens first

2. Mounting - When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase. Constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount all occur in this order during mounting.

3. Constructor, React updates, Render, componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount

4. componentDidMount() - This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, donâ€™t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().

## state vs props

1. Data values: You can pass any type of data values such as strings, numbers, booleans, objects, arrays, and even functions.

2. Source of data: Props are passed down from a parent component, while state is managed within a component itself.

- Mutability: Props are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component, while state can be updated by the component itself.

- Scope: Props are passed from parent to child components, while state is local to a single component.

- Trigger for re-render: Changes to props do not trigger a re-render, while changes to state will trigger a re-render.

3. When do we re-render our application? when change occurs.

4. User input: State can store the value of user input from form fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.

- Visibility of UI elements: State can determine whether a UI element is visible or hidden based on user actions or system events.

- Authentication status: State can store information about the user's authentication status, such as whether they are logged in or not.

- Error messages: State can hold information about error messages that need to be displayed to the user, such as validation errors or server errors.

- Loading status: State can indicate whether data is being loaded from an API or not, and display loading indicators to the user until the data is available.

- Selected options: State can store the selected option in a dropdown menu or a list of items.
