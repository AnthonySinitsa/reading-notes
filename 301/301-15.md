# authentication

1. OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential. In authentication parlance, this is known as secure, third-party, user-agent, delegated authorization.

2. when you go to log onto a website and it offers one or more opportunities to log on using another website’s/service’s logon.

3. The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth, providing the user’s verified identity. The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved. The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user’s client software. The client’s software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider (which may or may not be the second site). If not already authenticated to the authorization provider, the client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website. The user approves (or their software silently approves) a particular transaction type at the first website. The user is given an approved access token (notice it’s no longer a request token). The user gives the approved access token to the first website. The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication on behalf of the user. The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user. The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring. OAuth is not the first authentication/authorization system to work this way on behalf of the end-user. In fact, many authentication systems, notably Kerberos, work similarly. What is special about OAuth is its ability to work across the web and its wide adoption. It succeeded with adoption rates where previous attempts failed (for various reasons).

4. OpenID began life in 2005 as a means for logging into the then-popular LiveJournal blogging site but quickly spread to other sites. The idea, in the early days of Web 2.0, was that rather than having multiple logins for multiple websites, OpenID would serve as a single sign-in, vouching for the identities of users. But in practice OpenID was difficult to implement on the developer side, and never really became that appealing to users, especially as there was competition in that space. By 2011, OpenID had become an also-ran, and, Wired declared that "The main reason no one uses OpenID is because Facebook Connect does the same thing and does it better.

## authorization and authentication flows

1. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of an entity, typically a user or a system, to ensure that they are who they claim to be. It establishes the initial trust and confirms the identity of the individual or system attempting to gain access. Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of granting or denying access rights and permissions to authenticated entities.

2. The client application initiates the authorization process by redirecting the user to an authorization endpoint of the identity provider (OAuth server). This redirection includes parameters such as the client ID, requested scopes, and a redirect URL. The user is presented with an authentication prompt by the identity provider and is asked to provide their credentials (username and password) to authenticate themselves. Once the user is authenticated, the identity provider generates an authorization code and redirects the user back to the client application's redirect URL along with the authorization code. The client application receives the authorization code and securely exchanges it with the identity provider for an access token. The exchange typically involves making a backend server-to-server request using the client ID, client secret, and the authorization code. The identity provider verifies the authorization code and returns an access token to the client application. The client application can then use the obtained access token to make authorized API requests on behalf of the user. The access token is usually sent in the authorization header of the API requests.

3. The client application generates a random string called a code verifier. The client application calculates a code challenge derived from the code verifier using a specific method such as SHA-256 hashing. The client application initiates the authorization process by redirecting the user to the authorization endpoint of the identity provider, similar to the standard Authorization Code Flow. However, in this case, it includes the code challenge and a code challenge method (S256) in the request. The user goes through the authentication process and grants permissions to the client application. The identity provider returns an authorization code to the client application through the redirect URL. Now, instead of directly exchanging the authorization code for an access token, the client application creates a token request and includes the code verifier with it. The client application sends the token request to the token endpoint of the identity provider. The request includes the authorization code, the code verifier, and other necessary parameters. The identity provider verifies the authorization code, checks the code challenge against the stored code verifier, and if they match, issues an access token to the client application.

4. the access token is returned directly to the client application as part of the redirect URL.

5. typically a backend server or a service, sends a request to the authorization server (identity provider) with its client credentials, including the client ID and client secret, through a secure channel. The authorization server verifies the client credentials to ensure the identity and authenticity of the client application.

6. Device Flow or Device Code Flow, is an OAuth 2.0 authentication flow designed for devices with limited input capabilities, such as smart TVs, gaming consoles, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It allows these devices to obtain user consent and authenticate themselves to access protected resources without a web browser.

7. application collects the user's credentials and sends them to the authorization server, along with its own client credentials. The authorization server verifies the credentials and, if valid, issues an access token directly to the client application. The client application can then use this access token to access protected resources on behalf of the user.
